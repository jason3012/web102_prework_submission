# web102_prework_submission
Hello, this is my submission of the prework for web102. The uploaded files contain my code for the several challenges that do the following:

- Display the statistics:
  - Total contributions
  - Total amount of money raised
  - Total number of games
  - Top funded game
  - Second top funded game

- Display the games in card format:
  - Name
  - Description
  - Amount of money pledged

- Sort the game cards with buttons:
  - Show Unfunded Only
  - Show Funded Only
  - Show All Games
  - These 3 buttons sort

- Optional customization:
  - I added in a search function using HTML and JS to help search for any of the listed games. The search bar was         also cleaned up and customized using CSS.
