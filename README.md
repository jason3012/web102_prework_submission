## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app. One challenge I faced frequently was correctly appending the right element. Sometimes I would refer to certain variables that were similar in name but regarded different things. Another challenge was getting comfortable with the use of the reduce and filter functions, whether it was syntax or the inappropriate function to use.
