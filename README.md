# web102_prework_submission
Hello, this is my submission of the prework for web102. The uploaded files contain my code for the several challenges that do the following:

- Display the statistics:
  - Total contributions
  - Total amount of money raised
  - Total number of games
  - Top funded game
  - Second top funded game

- Display the games in card format:
  - Name
  - Description
  - Amount of money pledged

- Sort the game cards with buttons:
  - Show Unfunded Only
  - Show Funded Only
  - Show All Games
  - These 3 buttons sort

- Optional customization:
  - I added in a search function using HTML and JS to help search for any of the listed games. The search bar was         also cleaned up and customized using CSS.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app. One challenge I faced frequently was correctly appending the right element. Sometimes I would refer to certain variables that were similar in name but regarded different things. Another challenge was getting comfortable with the use of the reduce and filter functions, whether it was syntax or the inappropriate function to use.
